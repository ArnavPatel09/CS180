# CS180
Repository for all the programs I made in CS180BLK during my first semester of college


Each folder represents a new assignment (with the files inside consisting of walkthough, debugging, and challenge java files)


In this course, I used Java to learn about GUIs, Server and Client Architecture, and Object-Oriented Programming
